Project: Blockchain-Powered Transparent Charity Platform
Problems/Issues
- Misuse of Funds: Donors cannot reliably track how their contributions are spent.
- Lack of Accountability: NGOs and charities often provide limited reporting on fund utilization.
- Erosion of Trust: Donors hesitate to contribute due to fears of corruption or inefficiency.
- Difficulty in Verification: No simple way exists to prove whether donations reached the intended beneficiaries.

Importance
- Donor Confidence: Transparency encourages more people and organizations to contribute.
- Better Impact: Funds reach the intended cause more effectively, maximizing social benefit.
- Fraud Prevention: Immutable records reduce chances of corruption and financial mismanagement.
- Scalability: The system can be applied globally across disaster relief, education, healthcare, and community development initiatives.

Technologies, Languages, and Frameworks
- Blockchain Platform: Ethereum (for immutable donation tracking)
- Smart Contracts: Solidity + Hardhat (for donation management, escrow, fund disbursement)

- Backend: Node.js + MongoDB (for NGO metadata, donor records)
- Off-Chain Storage: IPFS/Filecoin (for receipts, reports, proof documents)
- Identity Verification: Civic / Polygon ID (for NGO KYC verification)
- Transparency Tools: The Graph (indexing donation flows), Dune Analytics (public dashboards)
